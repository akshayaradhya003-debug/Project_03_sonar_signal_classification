# Project_03_sonar_signal_classification

This project builds a Machine Learning classification system to identify whether an underwater object detected by sonar signals is a Rock or a Mine.

Using signal frequency measurements collected from sonar returns, the model learns patterns and predicts object type using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
